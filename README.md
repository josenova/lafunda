# lafunda

La Funda was an online casino startup located in Santo Domingo. I developed this RoR platform for the company that served as a middleware between the casino's payment and gaming services and also includes a front-end website where users could create their account, log in and submit inquiries. 

Project technologies included HAML for templating, Savon for SOAP requests, Devise for authentication and Capistrano for deployment.
